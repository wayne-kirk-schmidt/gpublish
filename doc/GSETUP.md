Google Specific Information
===========================

There are several steps to building a Google Application

1. Create a specific Google Project

2. Enable the Google Drive API for that project

3. Configure an Application that will run in the Project to use the API

4. Provide a consent screen for the Application

5. Assign a credential to the Applicatin and Consent Screen

6. Create Oauth credentials that can be used to authenticate

7. Authorize the credentials with your account using the consent screen

8. The credentials are given a token stored in a pickle file

9. This pickle is refreshed, and needs to be rerun if credentials, projects, applicatioons, or SCOPES change

| Copy the downloaded secret file to a directory of your choosing. An example is shown below:  |
| prompt> cp ../client_secret_XXX.apps.googleusercontent.com.json /tmp/credentials.json        |
|                                                                                              |
| Run the quickstart.py script to authorize the credentials. An example is show below:         |

|                                                                                              |

| Step-021: Then consent to the permissions being granted this google application              |
|                                                                                              |
